# mongodb-stylish-docs

Stylesheet used for Dark MongoDB Docs, the Stylish theme. This theme will be
slowly improved as time goes on, as long as there aren't many drastic changes to
the site. If you'd like to follow progress, trello board is below

## Latest Update

June 27, 2018 (v0.6 AKA the "Color" update):

* General changes to the color scheme being used, coming more in-line with the new colors deployed across MongoDB. Shweet.

## History

June 17, 2018 (v0.5 AKA the "Finally" update):

* Took the time to adequately update the docs for Stitch's overhaul; please let me know if there are any big things that I've missed.
* Transitioned development work to SCSS so that my sanity can be maintained in the future. Still in a state of refactoring at the moment.
* Fixed a lot of miscellaneous graphical bugs that I didn't really account for previously.
* _Finally_ compiled a local environment so that I can develop this theme properly. That's not really a external update, but it is pretty nice.
* Fixed up many code block edge-cases, although the main use still doesn't have a dark theme; I'll get around to it...eventually. Maybe. Don't hold your breath.

December 20, 2017 (v0.4):

* Fixed the Stitch iOS API docs, still needs a tad more work related to code blocks (coming in future update)
* Other minor updates

December 4, 2017 (v0.3):

* Fixed some highlighting issues for code parameter explanations

November 28, 2017 (v0.2):

* Updated table layout
* Added 'cloudmanager' & 'opsmanager' to the regex matcher

November 27, 2017 (v0.1):

* Initial push to Stylish
* Initial implementation of the Tutorials page--needs a bunch more work on
  subsequent page styles
* Tutorial section largely completed, although code seems to be the most
  finicky. If you find anything that needs to be modified (low contrast, hard to
  view, etc.) please let me know by
  [filing an issue](https://github.com/macintacos/mongodb-stylish-docs/issues)
  and linking to the page.
* Currently working on completely revamping the code view, as it's still
  essentially in the white theme. Don't like it at all. Will change soon.

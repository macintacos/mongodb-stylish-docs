# mongodb-stylish-docs

Stylesheet used for Dark MongoDB Docs, the Stylish theme. This theme will be
slowly improved as time goes on, as long as there aren't many drastic changes to
the site. If you'd like to follow progress, trello board is below

November 28, 2017 (v0.2):

* Updated table layout
* Added 'cloudmanager' & 'opsmanager' to the regex matcher

November 27, 2017 (v0.1):

* Initial push to Stylish
* Initial implementation of the Tutorials page--needs a bunch more work on
  subsequent page styles
* Tutorial section largely completed, although code seems to be the most
  finicky. If you find anything that needs to be modified (low contrast, hard to
  view, etc.) please let me know by
  [filing an issue](https://github.com/macintacos/mongodb-stylish-docs/issues)
  and linking to the page.
* Currently working on completely revamping the code view, as it's still
  essentially in the white theme. Don't like it at all. Will change soon.
